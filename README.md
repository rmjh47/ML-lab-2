# ML-lab-2

This project focuses on a supervised machine learning classification problem: predicting the presence of heart disease based on patient medical attributes.

The dataset contains clinical features such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other health indicators. The objective is to analyze the data and prepare it for building predictive machine learning models.

The notebook included in this repository loads the dataset and displays basic information such as shape, columns, and sample records.
